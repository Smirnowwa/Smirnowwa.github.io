          <h5> The Japanese term manga refers to cartooning and comics or whimsical sketches. Outside Japan, manga can mean, simply, comic books published in Japan. The origin of manga may date back all the way to 12th century scrolls. But many dispute this because of the right-to-left reading style of manga comic books.  Modern manga as we now know it has been historically and culturally influenced by two factors—pre-War (Meiji and pre-Meiji) Japanese culture and arts, and the events following WWII.

The very first manga magazine, Eshinbun Nipponchi, was published in 1874 by Kanagaki Robun and Kawanabe Kyosai. It was likely influenced by the pioneering Japanese magazine The Japan Punch, which was published between 1862 and spring 1887 by Charles Wirgman. Eshinbun Nipponchi did not have initial success and was discontinued after only three issues. This was followed by Kisho Shimbun in 1875, Marumaru Chinbun in 1877, and Garakuta Chinpo in 1879.</h5>
